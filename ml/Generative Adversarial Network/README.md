GANs are kinds of neural network used to generate data. It consists of two neural networks: the generator to create fake data and a discriminator to classify these images as real or fake. In the training, they become more experient on real data and eventually the generator will learn how to create realistic data, in this case, images.

Here we use the MNIST dataset to generate fake handwritten digits.

## How to use
To use this project, simply run the cells of the notebook in sequential order.
