Dimensionality reduction seek and exploit the inherent structure in the data, but in this case in an unsupervised manner or order to summarize or describe data using less information.
This can be useful to visualize dimensional data or to simplify data which can then be used in a supervised learning method. Many of these methods can be adapted for use in classification and regression.

* Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
* Principal Component Regression (PCR)
* Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR)
* Sammon Mapping
* Multidimensional Scaling (MDS)
* Projection Pursuit
* Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
* Mixture Discriminant Analysis (MDA)
* Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)
* Flexible Discriminant Analysis (FDA)
