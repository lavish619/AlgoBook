    "\n",
    "Going by the definition, **Principal Component Regression (PCR)** is a regression algorithm used for datasets having **multi-collinearity**.\n",
    "\n",
    "It constitutes the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Perform **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** on the dataset to reduce the number of features and obtain the **Principal Components (PCs)**.\n",
    "2. Perform **Linear Regression** on the obtained **Principal Components (PCs)**."

    "\n",
    "1. In multi-variate Linear Regression, it may appear that **we do fit the model well** but there is normally a **high variance problem** on the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The algorithm takes more time for training the features because of the larger number of input features."

    "\n",
    "PCR reduces the number of features on which regression is performed. It thus **adds a slight bias**. Hence, we now fit the model with a **slightly less training accuracy** but have **reduced the variance to a large extent**. \n",
