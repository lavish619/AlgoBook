## What is Naive Bayes :question:

* Naive Bayes is a probability based machine learning algorithm that is used for large volumes of data.
* It gives very good results when it comes to NLP tasks such as sentimental analysis. 
* It is a fast and uncomplicated classification algorithm.
* It is based on the *Bayes Theorem* with an assumption of independence among predictors.

## What are it's applications :closed_book:?

* **Real Time Prediction:** As Naive Bayes has low Time Complexity, it can be easily deployed and used for real time applications.
* **Multi-Class Prediction:** The algorithm can be used in multi-class prediction scenario as it can predict the posterior probability of mulltiple classes of the target variable.
* **Natural Language Processing:** Because of their good performance in multi-class settings, Naive Bayes tends to be very useful in  NLP applications like:
    * Text Classification
    * Spam Filtering
    * Sentiment Analysis, etc.
* **Recommendation Systems:** It helps in recommendation system because of probabilistic prediction ability and low time complexity.

## Types of Naive Bayes Algorithms:file_folder::

* **Gaussian Naive Bayes:** 
    * Used in Classification
    * Assumes that features follow normal distribution
* **Multinomial Naive Bayes:**     
    * Suitable for classification with discrete features, e.g., word count for text classification.
* **Bernoulli Naive Bayes:**    
    * Used for data that is distributed according to multivariate Bernoulli distributions.
    * Features should be independent booleans.
    
## Why is Naive Bayes so naive :open_mouth:?

* Naive Bayes (NB) is ‘naive’ because it makes the assumption that features of a measurement are independent of each other.

## Pros and Cons of Naive Bayes:
### Pros :white_check_mark::

* Highly extensible and fast algorithm , Time Complexity:O(nK), where n is the number of features and K is the number of class lables.
* Performs well in both binary and  multi-class settings.
* When assumption of independence holds, a Naive Bayes classifier performs better compare to other models like logistic regression and you need less training data.
* Performs well whin data is categorical or normally distributed.
* Can be easily trained on small datasets and can be used for large ones as well.

### Cons :x::

* The main disadvantage of the NB is considering all the variables independent that contributes to the probability. 
* If categorical variable has a category (in test data set), which was not observed in training data set, then model will assign a 0 (zero) probability and will be unable to make a prediction. This is often known as “Zero Frequency”. To solve this, we can use the smoothing techniques like Laplace or Additive smoothing.
